## Clicky-Game

This is a memory game built using React [Create React App]. The goal is to click all 12 cards only one time. If a card is clicked more than once, then the player loses and the score is reset to 0. The app keeps track of the user's score. 

Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.
Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
